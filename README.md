# WordGame
This is a project I made for a lesson. Using C# and MySQL.
In this wordgame, player answers 14 questions which their answer word lengths ranges from 4 to 10. Starts from 4, ends at 10. There are 2 questions for each answer word length.
Since the usage of database ID system in the code is fixed - id always starts from 1 - adding questions is a bit tricky.

Adding Questions Guide  
1- Download and import database to your mysql workbench.  
2- Launch the program, go to "manage questions and answers panel"  
3- Click on "get questions and answers from database"  
4- Select question you want to remove from the list.  
5- Click on delete to delete the question.  
6- Remove every question with the same way.  
7- After step 6, click on the "Reset Database ID System"  
8- Start adding new questions and answers. Don't add more or less than 14 questions. It has to be exactly 14.  

Here are screenshots from the program
